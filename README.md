Script to run statistical analysis in python

If you have data with a group structure this performs

-Remove outliers per group
-Descript data
-Anova
-Multiple comparisons
-Liniar regression

The input required is a .xlsx but it can be anything while it is converted to a pandas dataframe (first lines)
Then you have to also change the column names and the group names (one column must have the 'group' name with the diferent names on it)
